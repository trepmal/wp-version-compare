WP Compare
==========

The idea was to create a tool that would easily tell you the noteworthy features and fixes between two WordPress versions. Then if you encounter an out-of-date install, perhaps a new client, you can quickly highlight all the reasons they should update.

I built this quickly, so there are certainly issues.

* it currently only goes back to 3.0
* it may not display properly in all browsers
